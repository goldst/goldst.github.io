**jsdoctest** parses [`jsdoc`](http://usejsdoc.org/) `@example` tags from
annotated functions and runs them as if they were doctests.

Inspired by the [doctest](https://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html) python
library, as well as its [doctestjs](http://doctestjs.org) javascript
implementation.

## Demo

![demo](/jsdoctest-demo.gif)

## Set-up
Here's a two line set-up you can use:
```bash
$ npm i -g jsdoctest && jsdoctest --init
Adding `jsdoctest` script to your package.json...
Installing `mocha` and `jsdoctest` with npm:
# ... npm doing some work...
You can now run doctests with `npm run jsdoctest` or `npm test`
```
This will add sensible defaults to your `package.json` which you can then edit.

## Test-case Format
Examples need to be valid javascript, followed by a comment with the string
` => ` prefixing the results:
```javascript
/**
 * @example
 *   returns10()
 *   // => 10
 *   returns20()
 *   // => 20
 */
```

It doesn't matter if the comment is on the same line or the next one, so the
following is also valid:
```javascript
/**
 * @example
 *   returns10() // => 10
 *   returns20()
 *   // => 20
 */
```

**Async test cases** are supported prefixing the expected results with the
` async => ` string and pretending to have the `cb` callback function.
```javascript
/**
 * @example
 *   takesCallbackAndYields10('here', cb)
 *   // async => 10
 *   takesCallbackAndYields20('here', cb)
 *   // async => 30
 */
```

**Promises** are also supported, just add the same `// async =>` prefix and be
sure not to use a variable named `cb` on your text expression.
```javascript
/**
 * @example
 *   returnsPromiseThatYields10('here')
 *   // async => 10
 */
```

## Examples
The [examples](/examples) directory has a couple of examples, which may be
useful. Better documentation will be added if the project raises in complexity.

## Usage
The recommended way of using jsdoctest is to use
[`mocha`](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha). That is made possible with:
```bash
npm i mocha jsdoctest
mocha --require jsdoctest <module-name>
```

There's also a rudimentary command-line interface, which can be ran with:
```bash
npm i jsdoctest
jsdoctest <module-name>
```

## Disabling
To disable running jsdoctests, while still requiring it with `mocha` (I don't
know why, but you may) you can set the `JSDOCTEST_DISABLE` environment variable
to anything (`JSDOCTEST_DISABLE=true mocha --require...`).
